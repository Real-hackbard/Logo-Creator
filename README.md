This is an example of how to use ```GdiApi.pas``` to program a compact but effective logo creator that creates logos from the installed Windows [TrueType (TTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) font set.

TrueType is an [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font#Outline_fonts) font standard developed by Apple in the late 1980s as a competitor to Adobe's [Type 1 fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_fonts#Type_1) used in [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript). It has become the most common format for fonts on the [classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS), macOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

The primary strength of TrueType was originally that it offered [font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font) developers a high degree of control over precisely how their fonts are displayed, right down to [particular pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), at various font sizes. With widely varying [rendering technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)) in use today, pixel-level control is no longer certain in a TrueType font.
